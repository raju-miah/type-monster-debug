                        <strong>Local Storage</strong><br>
                        1. The storage capacity of local storage is 5MB/10MB
                        <br>

                        4. There is no transfer of data to the server
                        <br>
                        5. There are fewer old browsers that support it

                        1. The storage capacity of session storage is 5MB
                        <br>
                        2. It's session-based and works per window or tab. This means that data is stored only for the
                        duration of a session, i.e., until the browser (or tab) is closed

                        <strong>Global Scope:</strong>
                        The variables defined outside of any function or curly brackets are
                        known as global variables and have global scope. Global scope means that the variables can be
                        accessed from any part of that program, any function or conditional state can access that
                        variable.

                        <br>
                        <strong>Block Scope:</strong>
                        Block scope is also a sub-type of local scope. The block scope can be defined as the scope of
                        the variables inside the curly brackets {}. Now, these curly brackets can be of loops, or
                        conditional statements, or something else. You are only allowed to refer to these variables from
                        within the curly brackets {}.

                        The Event Loop has one simple job â€” to monitor the Call Stack and the Callback Queue. If the
                        Call Stack is empty, the Event Loop will take the first event from the queue and will push it to
                        the Call Stack, which effectively runs it. Such an iteration is called a tick in the Event Loop.

                        A variable that has not been assigned a value is of type undefined . A method or statement also
                        returns undefined if the variable that is being evaluated does not have an assigned value. A
                        function returns undefined if a value was not returned
